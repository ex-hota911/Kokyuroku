	I. Regularity of solutions and second-order error estimates for spatial

  journal = {SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis},

  pages = {275--311},
  abstract = {Abstract. This is the first part of a work dealing with the rigorous
	error analysis of finite element
	
	solutions of the nonstationary Navier-Stokes equations. Second-order
	error estimates are proven for spatial
	
	discretization, using conforming or nonconforming elements. The results
	indicate a fluid-like behavior of
	
	the approximations, even in the case of large data, so long as the
	solution remains regular. The analysis
	
	is based on sharp a priori estimates for the solution, particularly
	reflecting its behavior as t -* 0 and as
	
	to- Xo. It is shown that the regularity customarily assumed in the
	error analysis for corresponding parabolic
	
	problems cannot be realistically assumed in the case of the Navier-Stokes
	equations, as it depends on
	
	nonlocal compatibility conditions for the data. The results which
	are presented here are independent of
	
	such compatibility conditions, which cannot be verified in practice.},
